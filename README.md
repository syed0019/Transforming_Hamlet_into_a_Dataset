# Transforming_Hamlet_into_a_Dataset
In this project, we used the techniques of PySpark, the MapReduce paradigm, transformations and actions, and data cleanup to transform the text of _Hamlet_ into a format that's more useful for data analysis.

The file `hamlet.txt` contains the entire text of Shakespeare's play Hamlet and it is one of his most popular plays.
